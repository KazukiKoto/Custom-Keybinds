Got bored of logging into FFxiv all the time so I made a keybind to do it for me.
Plan is to have any keybinds I want to automate things for me be here and assign this program as a startup program.
Im gonna try to reduce the resource usage of the program as much as possible for weaker computers not to notice it running in background.
